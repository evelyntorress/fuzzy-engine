# -Portfolio-
## Description

The following project is to create a Portfolio, that can showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.
Highlighting my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 
Use of flexbox, media queries, CSS variables and finally deployed web applications.



- The source code has semantic HTML elements.
- The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical structure.
- The image elements have alt attributes defined.
- The heading attributes have sequential order.
- The title element is concise and descriptive.




There was a link not working properly. Is fixed. All links are functioning correctly now.

There is a semantic structure of the HTML elements.

Comments are included before each element or section of the page.

## The efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties:

- The CSS for h3 and h2 was changed, they were put all together because this way is more concise and there is no need to do a separated one for each title since are all h3 or h2.

- The margin-bottom and color properties were added to the benefits class, instead of having them added all in a different class. Since are the same values they can go all together.

- The images of the links have all the same property, so I made them more concise.
