# -Portfolio-
## Description

The following project is to create a Portfolio, that can showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.
Highlighting my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 
Use of flexbox, media queries, CSS variables and finally deployed web applications.

Portfolio consist
developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
click one of the links in the navigation
the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
click on the link to the section about their work
UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
click on the images of the applications
taken to that deployed application
resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


Comments are included before each element or section of the page.

## The efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties:
